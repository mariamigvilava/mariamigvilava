    <p class="p1">Cat</p>
    <p class="p2">The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or 
        house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated 
        species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication
         of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely
          as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable
           claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth,
            and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular 
            predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting–as
             well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small 
             mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>

    <p class="p1">Mercedes>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

        Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.[11][12]
        
        
        Gottlieb Daimler (1834–1900) – founder of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft
        Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.[13]</p>
