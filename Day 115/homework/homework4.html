    <h3 class="ty2">Tyler Gregory Okonma (born March 6, 1991), known professionally as Tyler, the Creator, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer.[2] He has been cited as an influential figure in alternative hip-hop during the 2010s.[3] Okonma became well known in the late 2000s, when he emerged on the internet as the leader and co-founder of the music collective Odd Future. Within the group, Okonma participated as a rapper, producer, director and actor, releasing studio albums that he produced for its respective members. Okonma also performed on the group's sketch comedy show Loiter Squad (2012â€“2014).

        Along with his collaborations with the group, Okonma developed his solo career beginning with his self-released debut studio album, Bastard (2009). Bastard earned him recognition in the online music press as an emerging artist from the indie music scene. His second studio album, Goblin (2011), brought him mainstream media exposure, aided by the popularity of the single "Yonkers" and its accompanying music video. During this period, Okonma faced controversy in the media for his horrorcore-influenced sound and his violent, transgressive lyrical content.
        
        After the release of his third studio album, Wolf (2013), Okonma began to separate himself from his horrorcore productions, turning to more accessible sounds incorporating fusions of jazz, soul and R&B. In 2015, Tyler released his fourth studio album, Cherry Bomb, which featured guest appearances from artists such as Lil Wayne and Kanye West. In 2017, Okonma released Flower Boy, which earned him widespread critical acclaim and commercial success. Subsequent studio albums Igor (2019) and Call Me If You Get Lost (2021) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and won Best Rap Album at the 2020 and 2022 Grammy Awards, respectively.[4] His eighth studio album, Chromakopia (2024), debuted at number one with the highest first-week sales of his career.
        
        Aside from his musical productions, Okonma became a significant figure in fashion with his clothing ventures Golf Wang and Le Fleur, and for his collaborations with major brands such as Lacoste, Converse and Louis Vuitton. Okonma is also the founder of the Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival music festival, which has been held annually since 2012, and which featured appearances by Kanye West, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Lana Del Rey, and Billie Eilish, among others. He has also directed all of the music and promotional videos of his career, under the pseudonym Wolf Haley. Okonma has won two Grammy Awards,[5] three BET Hip Hop Awards, a BRIT Award, and a MTV Video Music Award. In 2019, he was named "Music Innovator of the Year" by The Wall Street Journal.[6] In 2024, the Los Angeles Times featured Okonma in its "L.A. Influential" series as a "creator who is leaving their mark" in Los Angeles</h3>
